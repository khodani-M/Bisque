		\subsection{Purpose}
			\paragraph\indent
			The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the NavUP System, it  will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the development of the system. It will also explain system constraints, interfaces and interactions with other external applications. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a client for its approval 					and as well as the stakeholders and interested parties in such a system.This document  will also serve as a reference for developing the first version of the system for the development team.

		\subsection{Scope}
			\paragraph\indent
			The “NavUP System” is a  WiFi-based mobile navigation application which helps users navigate on campus to various venues to attend meetings , classes or shops, restaurants and ablution facilities based on the user’s current position and other specifications like restrictions specified by the user such as accessibility for people with disabilities or avoiding pedestrian traffic 					congestion. The application should be free to download from either a mobile phone application store or similar services.\\
			Furthermore, the software needs the campus wi-fi  or Internet and GPS connection to fetch and display results to users on their smart devices. The current location of the user should be determined both outdoors and indoors ,Various activities that uses location and movement of users can also be integrated.

				\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
				    \paragraph\indent
				    Hardware interfaces that we shall make use of:
						\begin{itemize}
						    \item An android phone or tablet.
						    \item An iPhone or iPad.
						\end{itemize}

				\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
					\paragraph\indent
						The mobile application must communicate with GPS application in order to obtain the geographical location of the user when the user is not inside a building, however if the user is inside a building – the mobile application must communicate with the router software to perform triangulation to find the exact location of the user inside the building.
						The mobile application must communicate with the database software to lookup events and  activies of interest to the user and provide information related to pedestrian traffic on campus.

				\subsubsection{Communications Interfaces}
				    \paragraph\indent
				    Communications that we shall make use of:
					\begin{itemize}
					    \item Cellular networks
					    \item Global Positioning Satellites (GPS)
					    \item Wireless networking (WiFi)
					    \item E-mail
					\end{itemize}

				\subsubsection{Memory}
					\paragraph\indent
					The system must be memory efficient due to the fact that mobile device do not have large amounts of memory and the application must be able run simultaneously with other applications.  
                    Typical android and iOS devices have 1GB of RAM or more, therefore to prevent overloading the operating system the application must use at most 50MB of RAM while the application is runnuing.
                    The application must use 50MB of hard disk drive space.

		\subsection{Product Functions}
			\paragraph\indent
            Users will be able to use their handheld devices to navigate around the campus if they having trouble to find venues. The system will assist the user to avoid pedestrian traffic and find the quickest route to their desired venue. The system will be able to locate the user’s current location either inside or outside the building by the use of the Wi-Fi access points. The system will store different types of information such as social events and activities, venues using multiple types of devices and services.The different types of information will be store on database. 

		\subsection{User Characteristics}
			\paragraph\indent
				NavUP should have three user groups: A student or staff member, a administrator, and a guest user.
				\subparagraph{Students and staff members}
    				\begin{itemize}
    					\item Students and staff members are registered, and have student numbers.
    					\item Students are likely to be young (Below the age of 30)
    					\item Students and staff members are likely to have a high level of education.
    					\item Students and staff members should have a relatively high level of technical experience, and therefore be able to use and navigate a relatively complex app.
    				\end{itemize}
				\subparagraph{Guest Users}
    				\begin{itemize}
    					\item Guests are unregistered.
    					\item The technical level and education of a guest is unknown. It might be difficult for them to navigate a complicated interface.
    
    				\end{itemize}
				\subparagraph{Administrators}
    				\begin{itemize}
    					\item Administrators should have a high level of technical expertise.
    					\item Administrators likely have some form of identification, such as a student number.
    					
    				\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Constraints}
                The constraints that we must work around are:
			    \begin{itemize}
			        \item \textbf{Cost} - We do not have the funds to pay for expensive libraries and tools.
			        \item \textbf{Time} - Most of us are third year and honours students, and so we do not have much time to work on the project. Additionally, we only have one semester to do this.
			        \item \textbf{Skills} - Our skills are varied, but mostly undeveloped, which limits the technical complexity of our solution.
			        \item \textbf{Scope} - Our scope is defined as a navigation system for the University of Pretoria, and so our solution should be limited as such.
			    \end{itemize}

	\end{itemize}

	\section{Specific Requirements}
		\paragraph\indent
				\subsection{External Interface Requirements}
					\paragraph\indent
					    Since the prototype will most likely only be developed for Android systems and later expanded to iOS and other systems, this part of the specification will primarily assume the Android OS is the operating system for the system.
					    \subparagraph{System Interfaces} 
					     - The app will require system privileges to make use of certain features and information provided by the Android OS.
					    \begin{enumerate}
					        \item  \textbf{Communication Protocols}\\
					        The app will be dependant on making use of the connection to the Internet provided through the device's connection to Wi-fi or mobile data. This will be necessary for the main functions such as mapping, location tracking, navigation and heatmaps (for traffic avoidance) to work.
					        \item \textbf{GPS}\\
					        We will be dependant on Android's GPS and location services to be able to accurately track both where the users are and where they are going. Access to this feature forms the backbone of the app as nearly all our subsystems are dependant on it.
					    \end{enumerate}

					    \subparagraph{User Interfaces}
					     - There will be a unified user interface which can be broken down into 5 subsystems all of which will be displayed simultaneously. The 6th subsystem (Suggestions) will tie into the navigational subsystem.
					    \begin{enumerate}
					        \item \textbf{Navigation}\\
					        Users will use the navigation subsystem to select a new destination, as well as deciding on their starting point. This information will be sent through to the mapping and location subsystems. It will eventually receive output from the mapping subsystem in the form of a route to follow which it will forward on to the display subsystem to display on screen for users.
					        \item \textbf{Location}\\
					        Users will passively interact with the location subsystem as it will autonomously track the device's location for input which the Navigation, Mapping, and Heatmap subsystems will use. It will continuously update the device's location and provide it as output to the mapping and/or navigational subsystem depending on context.
					        \item \textbf{Mapping}\\
					        This will calculate the route which the user has to take. It will accept input from the Location, Heatmaps, and the Navigation subsystems and then use that information to calculate the best possible route which it will provide as output.
					        \item \textbf{Heatmaps}\\
					        This will make use of packet sniffing or a similar technique to discover how many people are connected to routers and are gathered in certain areas at certain times. It will compare this to it's own averages gathered over time to calculate whether or not an alternative route or warning should be displayed due to high amounts of foot traffic in certain parts of campus
					        \item \textbf{Games and Events}\\
					        These events and games will be managed by users with creative privileges on the app. It's suggested that a form of validation and moderation is placed either on the people given creative privileges or on the events and games that they wish to add to the app. These games and events will then be added into the map so that they can be displayed and interacted with by 'normal' users
					        \item \textbf{Suggestive Searching}
					        This will be a minor add-on to the Navigational Subsystem which will suggest new locations and events to users based on their existing searches.	        
					        
					    \end{enumerate}
    					\subparagraph{Hardware Interfaces}
    						\begin{enumerate}
    						    \item \textbf{An android phone or tablet} \\
    						    Android will be the most common device used, and will likely be the only device we develop a solution for. There are android devices with many varying specs, but we will focus on newer models in order to simplify the prototype. \\
    						    Tablets are not used often for navigation, but due to the nature of Android the app will work there as well.    						    
    						    \item \textbf{An iPhone or iPad} \\
    						    It is possible but unlikely that we develop an app for iOS, as only a small percentage of staff and students use iPhones or iPads.
    						\end{enumerate}
    						
    					\subparagraph{Software Interfaces}
        					\begin{enumerate}
        					    \item \textbf{Google Maps API}\\
        					    This would be our preference of choice to use as the basis for the Navigation and Mapping systems as much of the functionality that NavUp requires for the Navigation and Mapping of UP is already available in this API.
        					    \item \textbf{Other}\\
        					    Other libraries and API's will likely be added to the project later to cater for the games and events once those features are better fleshed out
        					    
        					    
        					\end{enumerate}

						\subparagraph{Communications Interfaces}
    						\begin{enumerate}
    						    \item \textbf{Cellular networks} \\
    						    We will use cellular networks for downloading and uploading data and information required to use the app, such as user credentials, heat-maps, and routing. \\
    						    
    						    \item \textbf{Global Positioning Satellites (GPS)} \\
    						    We might use GPS to locate the device for heat-map generation and navigation.    						    
    						    \item \textbf{Wireless networking (WiFi)} \\
    						    WiFi will be used where possible to download and upload data similar to cellular networks. WiFi will also be used to locate the device similar to GPS, especially inside where GPS connection may be poor.    						    
    						    \item \textbf{E-mail} \\
    						    We may use email for registration and login, as well as passing information on to the user.  \\
    						    \textbf{Input}: The user's email address. \\
    						    \textbf{Output}: An email to the user containing information.    						    
    						    
    						\end{enumerate}
    						
				\subsection{Functional Requirements}
					\begin{itemize}
					    \item \textbf{Requirement 1 (R1)}\\ The system shall allow users to create a profile to log in and out of, or it should make another allowance for their personal data to be associated with them. This data could alternatively just be stored locally on their device, similarly to a cookie for a website. The personal data is needed to store users personal searches which are needed for the Suggestions subsystem. Once the users have entered their details a request is sent to the server and they will be logged in to the system if their details were correct. If they aren't then an error will be generated declaring that their details were incorrect. \textbf{Priority : Important but not vital}
					    \item \textbf{Requirement 2 (R2)}\\ Regardless of the task that a user is performing, the system shall always generate an error if the device has no connection to the Internet. The error will be dismissable but until a connection to the Internet is restored, the system shall only have access to partial functionality. \textbf{Priority : Critical}
					    \item \textbf{Requirement 3 (R3)}\\ The system shall provide users with the ability to select a starting location. Users can either have the app automatically detect their location or they can manually enter a location of their choice. The Location Subsystem will have to perform a validity check on manual addresses to check that they are real. If they aren't an error will be generated declaring that the address couldn't be found. \textbf{Priority : Critical}
					    \item \textbf{Requirement 4 (R4)}\\ The system shall provide users with the ability to select a destination. Users will have to manually enter a destination. The Location Subsystem will have to perform a validity check on the address to check that they are real.  If they aren't an error will be generated declaring that the address couldn't be found.  \textbf{Priority : Critical}
					    \item \textbf{Requirement 5 (R5)}\\ The system shall provide users with the ability to request a route between the starting location and destination. The system will send both points to the Mapping Subsystem after they have been validated by the Location Subsystem. The mapping system will then calculate the optimal route between the two points. This route will be displayed as output to the user. If no route is available then the system will generate an error describing so. \textbf{Priority : Critical}
					    \item \textbf{Requirement 6 (R6)}\\ The system shall create an alert for users for if the heatmaps subsystem detects there is high traffic on the shortest route or if there are other hazards on campus. The values tallied by the Heatmaps Subsystem will have to compare the real-time values to recorded averages to decide whether there is actually traffic or not. If the Heatmaps Subsytem can't receive any data from the system it should generate an error describing that the traffic feature is offline. \textbf{Priority : Important but not vital}
					    \item \textbf{Requirement 7 (R7)}\\ The system shall also provide the option of calculating a detour in the previous scenario if the user wants. This links back to the Mapping Subsystem which can use an intermediary location to create a detour between the two points. \textbf{Priority : Important but not vital}
					    \item \textbf{Requirement 8 (R8)}\\ The system shall suggest new locations on campus to users based on their searches. These searches will be tied to their profile and the suggestions will be built off of that. This system should generate an error if the file containing user's searches can't be accessed. \textbf{Priority : Nice to have, not vital}
					    \item \textbf{Requirement 9 (R9)}\\ The system shall allow 'content creation' users to create events and games for other users to interact with. Additionally it will also allow lecturers to create a venue for lectures, tutorials or practicals in the case of unforeseen circumstances making it that normal arrangements don't hold. In the scenario that events can't be created or events and games can no longer be accessed, the system shall generate an appropriate error. 
					    \textbf{Priority : Nice to have, not vital}
					    \item \textbf{Requirement 10 (R10)} \\ The system shall allow users to interact with the events and games created by content creation users. If these events can't be accessed the system will generate
					    an error.
					\end{itemize}

				\subsection{Performance Requirements}
    				The system must:
    				\begin{itemize}
        				\item Be interactive to user input within 2 seconds.
        				\item Acquire the user's location with an accuracy within an 8m radius.
        				\item Display the user's location on a map within 3 seconds after launching.
        				\item Generate routes for users within 2 seconds.
        				\item Update the user's location every second when navigating.
        				\item Give a warning or indication if the processes take longer than anticipated.
        				\item Display a message if an error is encountered.
    				\end{itemize}


				\subsection{Design Constraints}
					\paragraph\indent
						...
	
				\subsection{Software System attributes}
					\paragraph\indent
				
				\subparagraph{Reliability}
    				The system must be able to all its functions under the stated conditions and produce correct and consistent results. 
    				\subparagraph{Portability}
        				\begin{itemize}
            				\item The system must be able to run on different operating environments or platforms i.e. the system must be able to run on iOS and android.
            				\item The system must be able to run on different mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.
        				\end{itemize}
    				\subparagraph{Robustness}
        				The system must be able to perform its required functions under rough or exceptional conditions. Since the system heavily depend on newtwork connections, however the application must be able to perform basic navigation functions offline.
    				\subparagraph{Security}
        				\begin{itemize}
            				\item Only administrators must be able to add data to the system.
            				\item The location of the user must not be broadcasted or used by another application. 
            				\item All data transmitted between subsystems must be encrypted.
        				\end{itemize}
    				\subparagraph{Reusability}
    				    The system must be reusable, it must permit itself to be used in a similar or different context with or without extension or customization.
    				\subparagraph{Efficiency}
    				    The system must be able to perform its functions and produce desired results with minimum expenditure of time and resources.
    				\subparagraph{Availability}
    				    The system must be always available provided that the minimum hardware requirements are met.
