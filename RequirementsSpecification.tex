		\subsection{User Characteristics}
			\paragraph\indent
				NavUP should have three user groups: A student or staff member, a administrator, and a guest user.
				\subparagraph{Students and staff members}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Students and staff members are registered, and have student numbers.
					\item Students are likely to be young (Below the age of 30)
					\item Students and staff members are likely to have a high level of education.
					\item Students and staff members should have a relatively high level of technical experience, and therefore be able to use and navigate a relatively complex app.
				\end{itemize}
				\subparagraph{Guest Users}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Guests are unregistered.
					\item The technical level and education of a guest is unknown. It might be difficult for them to navigate a complicated interface.

				\end{itemize}
				\subparagraph{Administrators}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Administrators should have a high level of technical expertise.
					\item Administrators likely have some form of identification, such as a student number.
					
				\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Constraints}
			\paragraph\indent
			    \begin{itemize}
			        \item \textbf{Cost} - We do not have the funds to pay for expensive libraries and tools.
			        \item \textbf{Time} - Most of us are third year and honours students, and so we do not have much time to work on the project. Additionally, we only have one semester to do this.
			        \item \textbf{Skills} - Our skills are varied, but mostly undeveloped, which limits the technical complexity of our solution.
			        \item \textbf{Scope} - Our scope is defined as a navigation system for the University of Pretoria, and so our solution should be limited as such.
			    \end{itemize}
